# Runtime Texture Viewer

Just a simple editor tool for S&box that lets you inspect textures at run-time.

* First, open the window:

* Then, log the texture in your gamemode/addon/whatever code to the console:

```cs
Log.Info(Texture.White);
```
* Click on the logged texture.

This will become obsolete if/when the game's built-in Inspector gets rewritten or this feature is implemented for it.
